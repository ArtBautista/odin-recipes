    <h2>Fried Chicken</h2>
    <pre>
        I love homemade fried chicken. Like, I REALLY love fried chicken. But  Korean style
        fried chicken takes the cake. It's easy, it can be  completely gluten-free and we
        are going to make both the classic  gochujang wings and one of my favorite sandwiches of all time. </pre>

        <li>Fry all the wings in batches until light golden in color. 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place on a wire rack to cool. Rinse and repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
